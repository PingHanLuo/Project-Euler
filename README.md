### Javascript solutions
=======================
##### I've solved these solutions fast and direct and I did not put them into functions. This would just require wrapping the solution in functions.
##### The js answers could be made comprehensive and does not require any libraries. Although sometimes libraries such as bigNumber would make it easier to deal with large numbers with JS 64 bit artitecture I chose to percieve that as part of the problem and used solutions such as arrays.
